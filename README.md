# Identifying-Informal-Leaders-in-Online-Review-Organizations
## Author: Ishika Narang

Online consumer reviews have become a central source of
information in digital marketplaces, shaping product
discovery, evaluation, and adoption. However, prior research
shows that influence in review systems is highly unequal: a
small subset of reviewers disproportionately shapes
collective perceptions (Dellarocas, 2023). Meaning, online
reviews look democratic  but influence is not. When
influence is unevenly distributed in the reviews,
organizations face the risk of misinterpreting feedback
and overreacting to highly visible opinions while
overlooking broader patterns, for example by discontinuing
a product or pricing it much lower to sell more. Thus, my
project treats Sephora’s review environment as an informal
influence network and asks: **who acts as “opinion leaders,
” and what signals make their influence stronger?**

RESEARCH QUESTIONS

1. Network Leadership: Can structurally central
reviewers be identified as informal opinion leaders?

2. Impact Relevance: Do these structurally powerful
reviewers differ in review outcomes
(ratings/helpfulness) compared to peripheral
reviewers, beyond pure activity?

3. Language as influence: Is influence reflected in
language and do opinion leaders use distinctive
vocabulary or narrative styles that “travel” across
product contexts?
